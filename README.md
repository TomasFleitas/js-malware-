# JavaScript Obfuscated Malware Injection Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of an obfuscated malware injection written in JavaScript. The malware was found in the [cryptoview repository on Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/toptier1005/cryptoview/src/master/). This repository was shared as part of a job opportunity challenge context on LinkedIn.

## Repository Contents

This repository includes the following files:

1. **`obfuscated.js`**: The original obfuscated JavaScript code extracted from the cryptoview repository.
2. **`deobfuscated.js`**: An attempt to deobfuscate the original malware code for analysis and understanding. Note that:
   - Some IP addresses referenced in the code result in `ECONNREFUSED` errors or do not respond, causing requests to hang indefinitely.

## Malware Location in the Source Repository

The malware injection code is located in the file [`server/routes/userPortfolio.js`](https://bitbucket.org/toptier1005/cryptoview/src/master/server/routes/userPortfolio.js) from the cryptoview repository.

### Key Observations:

- The file has a **large horizontal scroll**, and the obfuscated code is **hidden on the last line** of the file.
- The placement and formatting appear deliberately crafted to make the malware inconspicuous.Online Platform for Deobfuscation

## How to Use

To examine the code:

1. Open `obfuscated.js` to see the extracted obfuscated malware code.
2. Review `deobfuscated.js` for an initial attempt to clean up and understand the logic.
3. Use tools or debugging methods (e.g., Node.js runtime) to further analyze the behavior and intent of the malware.
